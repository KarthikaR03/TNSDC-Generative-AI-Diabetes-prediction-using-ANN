# TNSDC-Generative-AI-Diabetes-prediction-using-ANN
Using Artificial Neural Networks to predict the possibility of having diabetes.

1.A dataset with the patient's medical data as characteristics and the patient's diabetes status as the target (whether or not the patient was diabetic) was utilised.
2.The dataset was divided into three sets: train, validation, and test.
3.Model evaluation and selection were performed using the train and validation sets.
4.The test set was used to evaluate model generalisation and how well the model performed on previously unseen data.
5.The best model, defined as the one with the lowest validation error, was saved and used for prediction.
